why do we use functions in programming?

reusability
easy to debug
reduces time complexity

def function_name(parameters):
  ...
function_name should be small letter

application memory
assignment memory

Garbage Collection: storing the data which are predefined/previous variables
ex:youtube buffering

dis--to show how variable are taking--desemble the function
